replace
Replace allows you to use the same effect with different markers. Damage transition effects support this for example.

gravity, up
The direction of gravity (down) and the opposite direction (up).  Always supplied

normal
Vector pointing directly away from the surface you collided with. Supplied for effects from collision.

forward
The 'negative incident' vector i.e. the direction the object is moving in. Most commonly used to generated decals. Supplied for effects from collision.

backward
The 'incident' vector i.e. the opposite of the direction the object is moving in. Supplied for effects from collision.

reflection
The way the effect would reflect off the surface it hit. Supplied for effects from collision.

root
The object root (pivot). These can used for all effects which are associated with an object.

impact
The location of a havok impact.
